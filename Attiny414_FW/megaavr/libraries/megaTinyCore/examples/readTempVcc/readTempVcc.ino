/* Minimal demo of using the ADC to read temperature and operating voltage
 *
 * Reading Vdd on the 2-series is VERY easy though, because there's a channel
 * called VDDDIV10, and the core presents it as ADC_VDDDIV10. Care to guess
 * what voltage analogRead(ADC_VDDDIV10) measures?
 *    Maybe... the supply voltage, Vdd, divided by 10?
 * So you can just switch to the internal 1.024V reference (or the others if
 * you prefer less accurate measurements) and read it. The math is even much
 * easier... with the reference voltages as multiples of 1024, the 1.024v
 * reference is in units of 0.25 mV. To get millivolts, just divide by 4.
 */

/* The 2-series temperature sensor on the other hand... well, frankly it seems to be
 * rather poorly calibrated. Batches are consistent amongst each other - but not with
 * the actual temperature. One user reported getting the very reasonable 300 or 299K value
 * for every chip he tested, as expected.
 * I tested 5 1624 and 3224 chips at ambient temperature of around 85 F (302 K), and consistently
 * got results between 313 and 318K. Running at 3.3V instead of 5V would lower the calculated
 * temperature by around 2K. It is most certainly not 105 F in my workshop, even though it is a warm day.
 *
 * So as regards temp sensing on the 2-series, YMMV
