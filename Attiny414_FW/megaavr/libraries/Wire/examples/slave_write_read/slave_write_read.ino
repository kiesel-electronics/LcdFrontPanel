/* Wire Slave Write/Read
 * by MX682X
 *
 * Demonstrates use of the Wire library
 * Writes/Reads data as an I2C/TWI slave device
 * Refer to the "Wire master_write_read" example for use with this
 *
 * If the #define ENABLE_RECEIVE is set, every byte in a Master Write is
 * printed to the Serial Monitor.
 *
 * If the #define ENABLE_REQUEST is set, the slave sends its millis()
 * (or placeholder) value to the master.
 *
 * To use this, you need to connect the SCL and SDA pins of this device to the
 * SCL and SDA pins of a second device running the Master Write example.
 *
 * Pullup resistors must be connected between both data lines and Vcc.
 * See the Wire library README.md for more information.
