/* Wire Master Write/Read
 * by MX682X
 *
 * Demonstrates use of the New Wire library
 * Writes or reads data to/from an I2C/TWI slave device
 * Refer to the "Wire slave_write_read" example for use with this
 *
 * Enter any data using serial monitor or other console followed by either or
 * both of the line ending characters. Depending on the first char, one of the
 * following happens:
 *    - if it's a 'm' or 'M', a master write is performed (if the #define is set)
 *    - otherwise a master read of 4 bytes is performed (if  the #define is set)
 *
 * To use this, you need to connect the SCL and SDA pins of this device to the
 * SCL and SDA pins of a second device running the Wire Slave Read example.
 *
 * Pullup resistors must be connected between both data lines and Vcc.
 * See the Wire library README.md for more information.
