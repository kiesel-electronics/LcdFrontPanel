# I/O header files
These are the I/O header files from the latest ATpack available at the time of writing, the Atmel ATtiny Series Device Support v1.10.348 package, corresponding to all 0-series, 1-series and 2-series parts. Files specific to parts not supported by megaTinyCore are not included. These files are included in the documentation largely because *all post 2016 AVR devices basically require you to have both the datasheet and IO header open* when writing any sort of meaningful code (contrast with older parts, where you needed only the datasheet - the longer names for everything on the modern AVRs are far more readable, and I agree with their decision to pursue the new naming scheme, and these parts are all an incredible improvement; so I don't mean to complain.... but would it have killed them to put the actual word-for-word names for registers/bitfields/etc to copy/paste, so we don't need to keep the header file open too? If you're going to extend the length of the names of bitfields to make for more readable code, that also makes them difficult to type with perfect spelling, capitalization, and underscores in the right places, such that basically everyone will copy-paste them. On the other hand, some of their datasheet PDFs are actually locked, so as to prevent you from copy-pasting material from them, so that policy would need to change too (there are many tools to unlock PDFs, of course, but it remains unclear to me what the business justification is for making it harder for people to spread the word about their products...) - it's not as if the contents of the datasheet will make anyone less likely to buy their parts...)

I am redistributing these solely as a convenience to users; particularly for less experienced users in the Arduino world, it turns out that being told to look at the header file is a bit daunting ("I found a bunch of iosomething.h files, but not the one for the chip I'm using" "In the Arduino folder? Oh no that's the version that the IDE came with, the core installed a new one..." "well where is it installed to?" "Okay so its in c:/users/(yourusername)/AppData/Arduino15/packages (so on and so forth), but AppData is hidden under..." "Uhhhh.... okay can't I just go download it" "Oh of course, you can download it from Microchip - download the file from this page. Then change the file extension to .zip - the download has the .atpack extension, even though it's just a zip file")

The ATpack files are all available from [http://packs.download.atmel.com/](http://packs.download.atmel.com/) They are licensed by Microchip under the Apache license.

The files in this location are NOT used by the core in any way, nor are they included in the board manager releases (the copy of the headers that are used are in `(toolchain root)/avr/include/avr`, where the root of the toolchain installation depends on your OS, how Arduino was installed, and the version of the core). The extras folder is not included in board manager releases at all. Nobody wants to have to dig up files installed via board manager, whether it's to find a header used by the compiler, a pinout chart, or the core documentation (the .md files are best read on github, anyway)

## From the Manufactuer's Changelog
(note: the ATpacks contain the headers, but also a ton of other stuff - "device-specs" and precompiled "libattiny_____.a" (a precompiled library of standard functions) and crtattiny.o (precompiled C runtime - roughly speaking, is a template for the linker to fill with the vectors and such, support files for their proprietary XC8 compiler, and support files for simulation tools - that's what they refer to when things don't make sense in the context of IO headers). Like the io headers, this is presented without any modification, including for spelling or formatting,
